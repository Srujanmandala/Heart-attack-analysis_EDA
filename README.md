# ðŸ«€ Heart Attack EDA: Young Adults in India

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of young individuals in India, focused on heart attack likelihood and risk factors.

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Data cleaning (e.g., blood pressure split, duplicates)
- Feature engineering (`Age Group`, `Heart Attack`, `Chol Category`, etc.)
- Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- KPI metrics (prevalence, gender breakdown, diet impact, etc.)

## ðŸ“‚ Files:
- `main.py`: EDA code
- `heart_attack_analysis/heart_attack_youngsters_india.csv`: data
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages
- `README.md`: This file

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset:
Original file: `heart_attack_youngsters_india.csv`  
Source: (mention source if known)

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Visuals:
- Pie charts (gender,hypertension,diet)
- Bar plots (cholesterol vs age group, physical activity)
- Histogram (age vs heart attack)

## ðŸ’¡ Insights:
- Prevalence rate: ~12.5%
- Males had 2Ã— the risk of females
- Smokers had a significantly higher risk
- Poor diet, high stress, and inactivity linked to higher risk
